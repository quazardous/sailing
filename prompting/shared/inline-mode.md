## Inline Mode

You are running in the **main repository** (not isolated).

> **Important**: This task should be executed by an **inline agent** (via Task tool), not by the main thread directly. Pass this context to the agent.

### Do NOT Commit

The coordinator handles git operations. Just implement and exit.
