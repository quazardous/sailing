# Constitutional Rules (Tier 0)

Violation = system failure. No exceptions.

1. **Rudder = single source of truth** for all state
2. **Main thread decides**, agents execute and return
3. **Never chain, infer, or decide** - execute only
4. **When in doubt: STOP, log, escalate** - never guess
5. **Memory not consolidated = lost**
6. **Use rudder commands** - never grep/search files directly
