# Reminders

## Memory Sync

Every 3-5 tasks: `rudder memory:sync`

If pending → consolidate before continuing.

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting memory:sync between batches
- Not checking deps:ready before spawn
- Accepting task with <2 logs
- Letting agent commit (user responsibility)

## Authority

| Who | Does |

| Skill | Decisions |

| Rudder | State |
