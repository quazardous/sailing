## Cross-Epic Patterns

<!--
Insights valid across all epics of this PRD.
Escalated from epic memories by skill curation.

Examples:
- API rate limit: 100 req/min, use debouncing
- All forms use Formik + Yup validation
- Auth token stored in httpOnly cookie
-->

## Decisions

<!--
PRD-level architectural decisions.
Document rationale for future reference.

Examples:
- Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for relational integrity
- WebSocket for real-time updates (not polling)
-->

## Escalation

<!--
Issues requiring PRD-level attention.
Patterns affecting multiple epics.

Examples:
- [E001,E003] Shared component causing conflicts
- Performance degradation when epics interact
