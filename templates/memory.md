# Memory: E000

## Agent Context

<!--
Actionable tips for agents. NO [TIP] prefix. Examples:
- Vue 3: use toRefs() for destructuring reactive props
- Run `make qddemo` to launch demo
- API endpoint requires auth header
-->

## Escalation

<!--
Issues requiring attention. Keep [TNNN] for traceability. Examples:
- [T042] Filter by status not working - needs investigation
- [T045] Performance degradation on large datasets
-->

## Changelog

<!--
Compiled history, NOT raw logs. See SKILL.md § Epic Memory.

Consolidation = summarize accomplishments, not reformat log entries.

Examples:
- [T138] Form builder: auto-field generation, field types
- [T139] CRUD operations with localStorage persistence
- [T140] Validation: required/email/url validators
-->
